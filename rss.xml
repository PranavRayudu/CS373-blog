&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my study habits in order and made big leaps in productivity by timing how long it takes to complete each task
and going to different places to study! I think a change in setting is very important for me to stay productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also participate in UT Programming Contest (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/utpc/%5D&quot;&gt;UTPC&lt;/a&gt;) this past friday and
it was a lot of fun but the food ran out before I got to it :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to find more recipes to make so I can eat regularly and stay healthy. I am thinking of trying out stir-fry
recipes from Ghenghis Grill make-your-own bowl cards since I’ve always liked the taste. I will let you know how
it tastes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue making good progress on my homework and working on work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #4: What Happens to Us?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that, like all articles I read on this topic, it is something I have to take to heart. As a boy, I
can only imagine how unfair the situation can feel for women and I want to be proactive to avoid these issues in my
workplace. For that, I am grateful for gaining another perspective and I hope to discuss how to solve these
problems with my peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of Collatz, exceptions, and types?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collatz was easy and I already knew the content for exceptions and types. It feels like it should just take an hour to
learn a week’s worth of lectures, so it is hard to care about lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how productive I have become after I commit to finishing some task when I start it. It made my weekend stress-free
and I was able to hang out with friends and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend made a cool browser extension to track your internship applications for you! It is called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/status-fyi/bihdcfkeidcjljeffcccehdlkplibmoj&quot;&gt;Status.fyi&lt;/a&gt; and it automatically
keeps track of the companies you applied to and lets you update where you are in the process. Everyone’s information
is pooled together to display aggregate application data for tons of companies. Be sure to give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Software Engineering: Post 3]]></title><description><![CDATA[What did you do this past week?

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the past week reading up on blockchains, practicing programming problems, and procrastinating on
project Collatz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it feels like I have a lot of work to do, I know that it is simply a function of not managing time properly.
I spent too much time on distractions like watching random videos on Youtube or reading random blogs. While it is
important to step away from work and take a break, I find that I use distractions to avoid stress. Instead,
I should plan out my day so I can work and get everything done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start implementing time-saving strategies like tracking time spent on projects, allocating fixed time per project,
and making sure I get something done every time I sit down to work. The idea is if I plan out when I will take breaks,
I will not feel like taking breaks all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the career fair is coming up. I also plan on visiting some exciting companies and introducing myself
to their recruiters. I hope to see you all there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #3: Continuous Integration?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it does a good job of introducing the philosophy of CI development, that paper was written in 2006 and it shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses arcane references (CruiseControl, Subversion, FIT, etc.) for tools no longer used, but I was hoping to learn
about modern tools (Git, CircleCI, Github Actions, etc.) and how software teams take advantage of
their capability and robustness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of IsPrime and Collatz optimizations?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IsPrime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Collatz&lt;/code&gt; projects were fairly easy to optimize, so they were stress-free;
I look forward to more challenges like this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see the results of my time at the gym! I can feel my posture improving and I am less tired after working all day.
If you have not hit the gym, try taking a run! A 10-minute jog is just as refreshing :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are not a fad. Blockchains like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ethereum.org/en/&quot;&gt;Etherum&lt;/a&gt; already proved that they work as a decentralized financial system.
However, there are other applications. Bleeding edge protocols like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; allow you to store and serve files on demand and are
completely fault-proof. It is bringing about the widespread adoption of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b&quot;&gt;web 3.0&lt;/a&gt;, where the internet is
completely decentralized. Don’t miss out. If you would like an awesome primer on blockchains, I linked a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw&quot;&gt;3 Blue 1 Brown&lt;/a&gt; video for you to check out!&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week, I managed to cook some new recipes I learnt from my mother. Most of those are curries and frys like
tomato curry, potato curry, chicken curry, potato fry, egg fry, etc. I hope that once I get comfortable with
making these I do not have to stress about food for the rest of the semester, although they do take a bit of time to
make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also practiced some coding problems and finished the HackerRank for project Collatz!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress of applying for internships is definetly taking its toll on me. I sit down to start working only to get hit
by the realization that still need to apply. It is hard to get anything done with a cloud hanging over my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start going to some org meetings that I think are cool, cook more instead of eating out, and try to
finish all my class work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #2: Makefile?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The makefile looked pretty standard compared to makefiles from other projects, but having aliases for batch git
commands seems unecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Makefiles are pretty neat tools that allow you to write pipelines for compiling or testing code.
However, they seem pretty complicated to work with and simply annotating a makefile is not enough to learn it.
I hope we go over how a makefile works in lecture soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of assertions, unit tests, and coverage? (this question will vary, week to week)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assertions&lt;/em&gt; are statements in your code that check if a boolean expression is true or not and fail immediately if false.
They allow you to test invariants in an algorithm and I use them in every project I work on. I cannot quantify how
many bugs I caught early on due to assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;em&gt;Unit Testing&lt;/em&gt; before and I think it works very well for this project. The input and output are
well-defined and creating more tests is very simple. However, it does require you to know the solution ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never used &lt;em&gt;Coverage&lt;/em&gt; before and am not sure it is needed for this project. I believe it is only useful in checking
if your tests are reaching every part of your codebase - best used for very large projects that many have
dead code that does not need to be maintained. All in all, I think this is the least useful tool of the three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been going to the gym with my roomates and I noticed some changes! I think my hard work is starting to pay off
now that my posture and strength has improved. Here is to maintiaing my routine into the semester!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember taking Operating Systems (CS439)? Remember how hard it was to fix race conditions, memory leaks, and null
pointers? Well, it could have been all avoided if you used a new programming paradigm. Introducing
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;, a programming language that does not even allow you to write such code.
It separates references into mutable and immutable references so that
&lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ownership-rules&quot;&gt;you can only have one mutable reference of an object at a time&lt;/a&gt;.
This already avoids problems with multiple threads writing to a single memory address.
It also has something called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html&quot;&gt;borrow checker&lt;/a&gt;
that makes sure all references are accounted for so you will not reference deallocated memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to check it out, you can find resources &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/learn&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and try running some
code in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;online playground&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where did you grow up?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first half of my life in Bangalore, India. After I turned 13, my parents decided to move to the
States, so I moved to San Antonio, Texas where I entered middle school at 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade.
Three years later, I moved to Dallas, TX where I completed high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What high school did you attend?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent my freshman year at Ronald Reagan High School in San Antonio and sophomore through senior years at Keller High
School in Keller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found our newly minted Robotics club to be the best extracurricular I participated in. We had a humble
yet ambitious atmosphere as we competed among thousands (3,790, to be exact) of other teams in the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc&quot;&gt;FIRST Robotics competition&lt;/a&gt;. We were not allowed to work on the robot after
a certain date so every regional event started off with me uploading new, untested code into the robot followed by near
complete failure and a melt-down in the entire team. Atleast it taught me the importance of writing bulletproof code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you come to UT?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UT is hands-down one of the best universities for Computer Science in the United States, so that made choosing UT very
obvious from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why are you majoring in CS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up code when found a YouTube channel called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman&quot;&gt;The Coding Train&lt;/a&gt; where
a professor named &lt;a href=&quot;https://shiffman.net/&quot;&gt;Daniel Shiffman&lt;/a&gt; made generative art using a javascript graphics library
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/&quot;&gt;p5.js&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually I landed on the engineering side of CS and started practicing
problem-solving and making web apps and lo and behold… I am now a CS major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why are you in this class?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard this class was a classic, must-take for a CS major at UT, so I wanted to see what it was about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are your expectations of this class?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to become proficient at writing software in large teams and know how to use all relevant tooling for such large
teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How much Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming do you already know?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fairly proficient in javascript and web programming since I picked those up early in high school. I use Python for
some of my projects and I used SQL for my past internship, so I have a some exposure to all these languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you like the first lectures?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best parts of lecture was using the versatility of Ed Discussion to ask questions in class and using a git repo
for lecture notes. I do wish it was more fast-paced though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you feel about the cold calling?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fine with it, but I need a couple of seconds before talking in front of the whole class and I am afraid of not
being able to unmute myself or having some other technical issue on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a new bike to commute to campus and it works perfectly! I have even ridden to downtown Austin with it and
it is overall a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/papers/robogrammar/index.html&quot;&gt;RoboGrammar&lt;/a&gt; is a 2020 MIT paper which describes a
graph-based approach to generate robot structures like body joints and links. Basically, they describe a way to
generate graphs that can be turned into robots that are optimized for smooth surfaces, stepped surfaces, etc.
It is cool because even with a few nodes, you can generate a huge variety of robots. Here is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/papers/robogrammar/paper.pdf&quot;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/allanzhao/RoboGrammar/&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; if you want to check it out.
I even a linked a quick video down below for you :).&lt;/p&gt;
