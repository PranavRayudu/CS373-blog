      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are long-term takeaways from this class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test first, test during, test after; test, test, test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when designing algorithms, demand the weakest capabilities (e.g., iterable vs. indexable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when designing containers, provide the strongest capabilities (e.g., indexable vs. iterable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build decorators on top of containers, iterators, and functions utilize the benefits of being lazy (e.g., yield)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always look for reuse and symmetry in your code collaboration is essential to the quality of your code and to your well-being in producing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refactor, refactor, refactor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make your code beautiful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How well do you think the course conveyed those takeaways?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing felt kind of pointless due to the small project scope and we only made rudimentary frontend and backend tests as filler. My team did not learn about how to setup and teardown a testing database or what to test on frontend tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the importance of designing flexible algorithms, containers, using decorators, and writing good code though. They are important concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Were there any other particular takeaways for you?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the emphasis on using weak capabilities in algorithms adds a new dimension to writing maintainable code. Unlike competitive programming where everything is based on efficient data structures, industry software also cares about flexibility and extensiblity. These are the big concepts I learned in this class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you feel about cold calling?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem with cold calling is that it restricts where I can take my class. I can only take classes in quiet spaces like study rooms or my own room because of the risk of being cold-called. I wish I had the flexibility to take the class in more lively areas with some background noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you feel about specifications grading?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements are reasonable but the restrictions on token usage for each category induces claustrophobia. I wished this class was heavy due to the demand of each project phase, but instead the class is hard because of all the restrictions with token usage and how little leeway students before they mess up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you feel about help sessions and office hours?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help sessions and office hours were chill! I liked the in-person component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you feel about the support from the TAs?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TAs were definitely the hardest working I have ever seen. I appreciate everything that Caitlin and Jefferson have done to help all the teams get through every phase!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I used Gitlab pipelines and think it is a neat feature. Pipelines force you to write code that can be checked for expected behavior automatically and is easy to setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s the most helpful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VSCode with LiveShare and Github CoPilot helped tremendously. VSCode allowed me to collaborate and debug with my teammates remotely while CoPilot provided auto-complete that completed entire blocks of code for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you feel about your group having to self-teach many, many technologies?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no problem learning everything because learning technologies is a journey and I have progressed further regardless of whether it was in or out of lecture. In fact, a lecture cannot possibly teach you how to debug esoteric Typescript errors so might as well let students learn to solve those themselves, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Give me your suggestions for improving the course, but apologies in advance; specifications grading will remain.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forcing students to come to lectures to learn basic python as slow as possible seemed like a waste of tuition money. I am fine with the lectures-project disconnect but given a host of interesting topics such as orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Ansible, Jenkins, etc.), security, authentication, etc. that make great lecture topics, it is unfair to spend so much of the semester on an easily learnable language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifications grading is fine, but the restriction of token usage for each category is not. Since most grades are either an &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;, we need more leeway than being able to resubmit papers once per term or blogs twice a term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture quizzes were terribly conducted. Canvas cannot enforce the 4-minute mark restriction and the professor voided your submission if you were off by 1 second. It took weeks before Downing added a better, but still haphazard cutoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the instructors&lt;/em&gt;: Please try to keep student’s interests in mind because it really felt like the professor followed rules above fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So long, and thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Software Engineering: Post 13]]></title><description><![CDATA[What did you do this past week?

&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a break after spectacularly completing my projects for SWE, Neural Nets, Applied Stats, and AI which were
all due this week. As a result, my next week has become very chill and I plan on enjoying my days back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not have much in my way because of how brutal this past week has been. I look forward to having an easy week and spending time with family for Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going back to my family on Monday for Thanksgiving and will stay in Dallas for the next week. I am not sure if Black Friday deals will be as exciting this year, but I want to walk around the displays with my friends and just hang out this Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #13: Why Extends Is Evil?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have waited a long time for “Why Extends is Evil” because I too independently recognized the problem with having classical inheritance in a language. I think that the “extends” operator made sense when languages like Java were being made because it was important to reuse existing code and inheritance made that possible. However, millions of people develop code now, and extends is not flexible enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of SQL?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think SQL is a completely different way to code because it is not Turing complete and has a different model for storing data. I think it is important to understand this relational algebra and the algorithms behind it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hung out with my friends every day this weekend so I am very happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Black Friday deals might not be as good as they seem? While many items have a huge discount for Black Friday, they are usually marked up a month before the sale so the discount is not so huge. Be careful about spending money this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Software Engineering: Post 12]]></title><description><![CDATA[What did you do this past week?

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came back to campus and did a fantastic job of surviving the past week! I brought back more clothes for the winter, bathroom supplies, and a heck-ton of food, resulting in a pretty easy week. I also enjoyed my experiment noodle-chicken bowls using the recipe cards I snagged from Genghis Grill. If you ever go there, I recommend the &lt;em&gt;Spicy Chicken Korean Bowl&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Make Your Own Bowl&lt;/em&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 1 project due on Sunday and 3 projects, 1 exam due on Monday. That basically involves every class I am taking this semester… I do not even need to describe the size of my backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week will be my last week on campus before Thanksgiving so I will try to enjoy it the best I can with my friends. I also think the visualization requirement of Phase IV is the most interesting part of the project so I will start experimenting with 3D globe libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #12: More Getters and Setters?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper “More Getters and Setters”, although useful, added a lot less to the conversation about getters and setters than the original paper. I wish we learned a new design paradigm or pattern that we can use in future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of cross join, theta join, natural join, and SQL?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have used SQL before, I am new to relational algebra and cross-join, theta-join, and natural-join terms. I implicitly used them in various SQL statements though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited about going back for thanksgiving more than anything that happened this week honestly. I have too much work to feel happy about my prospects right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utrecsports.org/facilities/facility/caven-lacrosse-and-sports-center-at-clark-field&quot;&gt;Clark Field&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome on-campus sports field that has a Soccer / Ultimate Frisbee / Lacrosse Field, Jogging track, Basketball courts, monkey bars, etc. that make it an excellent sports facility. You can check out any equipment you’d like until 11 pm night and have a ton of fun. Plan out your visit by finding the best time to visit Clark Field &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utrecsports.org/about/isitbusy&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Software Engineering: Post 11]]></title><description><![CDATA[What did you do this past week? This past week, I played IM soccer out in the rain and cold and went back home to Dallas for Diwali.

&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week, I played IM soccer out in the rain and cold and went back home to Dallas for Diwali.
Soccer was brutal since it was windy, 50°F, and raining all at once on Wednesday… but it built character 💪.
I also got to see my family in person for the first time after coming to campus, so that was
a nice change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time this semester, I do not think I have any major blockers right now. I must make
good progress on SWE phase III though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will add filters and proper pagination and sorting and all sorts of eye candy to my SWE website. I hope
that this phase goes more smoothly than the other phases since they were pretty rough towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I probably ate the sugar output of an entire sugar field in sweets during this weekend so I will stay as
healthy as possible this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #11: Getters and Setters?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is rather basic in my opinion since it can be summarized in a few sentences. No doubt I agree
that getters and setters are the banes of the OOP design pattern, but I caught that fairly early in my
programming career and I am sure others are aware of the anti-pattern already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of relational algebra, select, and project?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am already familiar with relational algebra and the select/project statement because I have used it in
my internship and past projects. I anticipate no friction in learning how they will be used in this class
or our SWE project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back home for Diwali! I lit candles and Diya lamps to celebrate the occasion and
just relaxed at home. I also got to attend my high school robotics team’s regional competition for the fall season and
catch up with my old engineering teachers. My team won regionals by a large margin!
You can find their website &lt;a href=&quot;https://kcalrobotics.weebly.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SWE project requires that your website is mobile responsive, and you should test your SWE frontend on a real phone.
To do that, add &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HOST=0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; to your frontend’s
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file or replace &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&quot;start&quot;: &quot;react-scripts start&quot;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&quot;start&quot;: &quot;HOST=0.0.0.0 react-scripts start&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in
your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;. Next time you run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt;, you will see that your react project is hosted on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;192.168.x.xx:xxxx&lt;/code&gt;
instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;localhost:xxxx&lt;/code&gt;. Open this same link on your mobile phone to see your website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Your phone and computer need to be on the same local network to communicate together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Software Engineering: Post 10]]></title><description><![CDATA[What did you do this past week?

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I and my team finished phase 2! We pulled through after the 1-day extension, which gave us just enough time to
complete all the requirements towards the climactic final hours. I also celebrated my friend’s birthday and
finished participating in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktx.com/&quot;&gt;HackTX 2021&lt;/a&gt;. I am completely famished after working for 24hrs,
but we won 3rd place for best blockchain project which you should check out
&lt;a href=&quot;https://devpost.com/software/bitsnacks?ref_content=my-projects-tab&amp;#x26;ref_feature=my_projects&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a massive backlog of work to do that I will get started on right after typing up this blog post. I have to
finish my neural nets assignment, grade assignments, and prepare for interviews this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start on phase III and spend more time with my friends. I think we all agree that we need to make
time in our busy schedules to meet each other and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #10: Dependency Inversion Principle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dependency Inversion Principle is an important general idea that I learned via trial and error. I think
every programmer can agree that a well-designed software project takes the DIP into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of =, *, ** and regular expressions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think destructing is a complicated but very useful topic in Python. I see it used very frequently in
machine learning libraries like PyTorch and Keras to make syntax clean.
Moreover, I have lots of experience with regular expressions and use them frequently when editing
code or formatting files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting together with my friends to celebrate a birthday and winning something for HackTX was the climax
of my past few weeks. I want to make sure the rest of my weeks are just as awesome as Halloween weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested in Blockchain or cryptocurrencies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://txblockchain.org/&quot;&gt;Texas Blockchain&lt;/a&gt; is
a UT org dedicated to the technical and financial side of cryptos. You can join their discord
&lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/rHEDeqrgQR&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and they generally hold informational meetings and technical workshops on
Wed and Thurs 6-7 pm in CBA 4.328.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Software Engineering: Post 9]]></title><description><![CDATA[What did you do this past week? I worked on my SWE project, finished midterms, and completed a lot of interviews. Oh, and I

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on my SWE project, finished midterms, and completed a lot of interviews. Oh, and I
also joined Intramural Soccer ⚽! We had our first weekly match on Wednesday and it was an absolute blast.
We lost but I know we will win the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My SWE project is still far from complete and I and my teammates are still wrangling the
monster that is scraping data so that we can finish in time. I would like to finish
adding all this data to the front-end as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will finish my SWE project, start running outside and practice for my next IM soccer match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #9: Interface Segregation Principle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISP is a good primer on the motivations behind having interfaces and multiple inheritances.
I think multiple inheritances reign far above other object models and I wish it were the
norm instead of regular inheritance. Either way, I look forward to using it in my projects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What were your experience of functions, closures, and decorators?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I looked forward to learning about closures and decorators so I am glad we
finally hit this topic. They occurred in multiple places during my coding career like
Flask/backend API frameworks, Python &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;functools&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Since they are paramount for so many
complex libraries, I am glad that I gained familiarity with these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I am more excited about next week… it’s Halloween 🎃! Lots of celebration and themed
parties to visit and it heralds the beginning of end-of-year festivities. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live off-campus, then you might live near an &lt;a href=&quot;https://austin.bcycle.com/&quot;&gt;Austin Bike Share&lt;/a&gt; bike rack.
Bike share lets you rent a bike from any metro bike rack, which is available on and near UT campus
(see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://austin.bcycle.com/stations&quot;&gt;map of all bike racks&lt;/a&gt;).
The best thing is, UT students can get an annual membership for $12 after signing up
&lt;a href=&quot;https://austin.bcycle.com/university-of-texas-at-austin&quot;&gt;on this form&lt;/a&gt;!
You can find more info &lt;a href=&quot;https://parking.utexas.edu/bcycle&quot;&gt;on the UT website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Software Engineering: Post 8]]></title><description><![CDATA[What did you do this past week?

&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week, I avoided the rain, enjoyed the sun and welcomed the beginning of Fall! I also went to Garba
this past Friday, which is a cultural celebration at the end of Navaratri that I have been looking forward to
for quite a while. All-round lots of excitement 😁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fear of deathly cold weather and the onslaught of rain at 11:00 pm terrifies me.
I was programming in my room Wednesday night and nearly jumped out of my seat when I heard thunder.
From now on, I will walk with worry during gloomy days where clouds gather for a thunderous discharge in the form
of rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid going out during rainy days and spend all day out during sunny days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #8: Liskov Substitution Principle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSP is an extension of the Open-Closed principle we read last week. I think LSP is more important than Open-Closed
because it clearly defines how preconditions and postconditions should be formulated in an inheritance
hierarchy. Good use of LSP is essential for writing APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of comprehensions, generators, and yield?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield function was interesting and I would like to find creative ways to use it other than for loops or list
comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garba, sunny weather, and being able to workout all helped me stay in high spirits this week. I am thankful for
being able to work with my friends on projects and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure&quot;&gt;Union Find algorithm&lt;/a&gt; is my new favorite algorithm and
is a very easy way to find connected components, cycles, and minimum spanning trees of a graph. Here is how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintain an array &lt;span class=&quot;math math-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;p&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot;

where &lt;span class=&quot;math math-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;p&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;p_i&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot;

&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a break after finishing Phase I for our project. We had a small hiccup with our Gitlab stats on the last day but
we managed to get it working on production. I had fun with friends and took it easy this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few pending and future interviews that I need to get through. I hope to do a good job on them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase II! My team has started working on phase II and I think it will be a good one. In this phase, we are using
linters, formatters, and issue boards to organize our code and work. Now that we are following all the suggestions
provided to us, this phase should go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of Paper #7: Open-Closed Principle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open-Closed principle is important to teach students but I honestly think it needs to be gained from experience.
One of the interesting comments I saw mentioned that students do not understand this because school projects only run
1-2 weeks long and the Open-Closed principle is not so useful. It is more useful on longer, semester-long projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of operators, and iteration?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Downing said, Python has meticulously designed functionality for operators and iteration, although I think they
are fairly simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such favorable weather! Sometimes I would walk out of class and just stand in the middle of Speedway because the
temperature, lighting, and wind were just right. The last time I was able to do this on campus was freshman year, so it
brings back memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go out y’all. During the evenings (around 5-6pm), the weather will be perfect for a walk outside or to just study. I
recommend sitting by the benches in front of Greg or the green plaza behind Jester Center because they are excellent
studying spots. Otherwise, take a walk down San Jacinto Boulevard which runs along Waller Creek if you just need
to chill!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Software Engineering: Post 6]]></title><description><![CDATA[What did you do this past week?

&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working on project #2 and I like how it is going so far. I am working on the frontend site, so I spent
some time researching the different frameworks and seeing how they feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather. It has always been the weather. I and my roommate got stuck the first time it rained in forever
on Tuesday, and now I carry a raincoat with me everywhere. It is a risk to go out during an overcast day,
where legions of raindrops await their impending assault on unprepared pedestrians. Be sure to carry an umbrella!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crunch out web pages like a madman and avoid the rain. I want our website to look cool and modern so I am taking
the time to experiment. I also do not want to get wet. These will be my primary directives for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of Paper #6: The Single Responsibility Principle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper was a good read about organizing our code and I really appreciate how it is well-timed for each
phase of our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of factorial, reduce, and operators?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not used &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; before but it is a neat trick that I hope to use sometime in the future, whether
it be for a coding interview or for a python project. I look forward to learning more of these higher-order
functions that can speed up code development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s UTPC competition was fun! I managed to snag food, a shirt, and a water bottle. I look forward to
getting more swag and completing problems in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides&quot;&gt;UT Night Ride&lt;/a&gt;! Every month, you get $100 of Lyft credits.
These credits can be used to go to your apartment past 12:00am and I have used them many times to study late on campus.
Although they can only be used when you are on campus, there is a region in west-campus that counts as on-campus
because it has university housing. I have attached a map of the coverage area below. have fun and stay safe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on work, worked out, and did coding interviews from different companies I applied to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I and my SWE group need to finish up our project proposal and I hope we can get it done soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hit the ground running on Project #2 and get a mockup of our project and the 14 pages
up as soon as possible. I will also start running this week because the weather has
calmed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #5: Pair Programming?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is a good primer on working with your fellow peers, although every
student experienced enough to take SWE knows the principles. Regardless, I am
convinced that all code should be written in pairs. Well, maybe not individual assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of Python’s object model, list, tuple, set, dict, and iterators?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used the Python object model and the other data structures in my projects before, so
they are nothing new, but I appreciate the refresher. I am looking forward to learning
more complex python concepts like decorators, closures, etc. that can use in my SWE project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun this weekend hanging out with all my friends. We did not do anything special
other than just going out, watching a movie, etc. but I liked seeing so many of my friends
and it was energizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the weather was perfect for the first time in forever! On Friday I sat on the benches
in front of Greg and worked, which was very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find stretching my legs after walking all day very satisfying.
My favorites stretches are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openfit.com/figure-4-stretch&quot;&gt;Figure Four stretch&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://yoga15.com/pose/runners-lunge/&quot;&gt;Runner’s Lunge&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensational-yoga-poses.com/hamstring-stretches.html#pyramidpose&quot;&gt;Kneeling hamstring stretch&lt;/a&gt;
for my legs, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellfit.com/the-towel-chest-stretch-2696334&quot;&gt;Towel Chest stretch&lt;/a&gt; for the upper body.
You should hold them for 30 to 60s and lean in slowly and lean as far into the stretch as you can. Even better,
they are all progressive stretches so you can start slow notice yourself getting better over time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Software Engineering: Post 4]]></title><description><![CDATA[What did you do this past week?

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my study habits in order and made big leaps in productivity by timing how long it takes to complete each task
and going to different places to study! I think a change in setting is very important for me to stay productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also participate in UT Programming Contest (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/utpc/%5D&quot;&gt;UTPC&lt;/a&gt;) this past friday and
it was a lot of fun but the food ran out before I got to it :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to find more recipes to make so I can eat regularly and stay healthy. I am thinking of trying out stir-fry
recipes from Ghenghis Grill make-your-own bowl cards since I’ve always liked the taste. I will let you know how
it tastes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue making good progress on my homework and working on work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #4: What Happens to Us?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that, like all articles I read on this topic, it is something I have to take to heart. As a boy, I
can only imagine how unfair the situation can feel for women and I want to be proactive to avoid these issues in my
workplace. For that, I am grateful for gaining another perspective and I hope to discuss how to solve these
problems with my peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of Collatz, exceptions, and types?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collatz was easy and I already knew the content for exceptions and types. It feels like it should just take an hour to
learn a week’s worth of lectures, so it is hard to care about lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how productive I have become after I commit to finishing some task when I start it. It made my weekend stress-free
and I was able to hang out with friends and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend made a cool browser extension to track your internship applications for you! It is called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/status-fyi/bihdcfkeidcjljeffcccehdlkplibmoj&quot;&gt;Status.fyi&lt;/a&gt; and it automatically
keeps track of the companies you applied to and lets you update where you are in the process. Everyone’s information
is pooled together to display aggregate application data for tons of companies. Be sure to give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the past week reading up on blockchains, practicing programming problems, and procrastinating on
project Collatz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it feels like I have a lot of work to do, I know that it is simply a function of not managing time properly.
I spent too much time on distractions like watching random videos on Youtube or reading random blogs. While it is
important to step away from work and take a break, I find that I use distractions to avoid stress. Instead,
I should plan out my day so I can work and get everything done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start implementing time-saving strategies like tracking time spent on projects, allocating fixed time per project,
and making sure I get something done every time I sit down to work. The idea is if I plan out when I will take breaks,
I will not feel like taking breaks all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the career fair is coming up. I also plan on visiting some exciting companies and introducing myself
to their recruiters. I hope to see you all there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #3: Continuous Integration?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it does a good job of introducing the philosophy of CI development, that paper was written in 2006 and it shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses arcane references (CruiseControl, Subversion, FIT, etc.) for tools no longer used, but I was hoping to learn
about modern tools (Git, CircleCI, Github Actions, etc.) and how software teams take advantage of
their capability and robustness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of IsPrime and Collatz optimizations?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;IsPrime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Collatz&lt;/code&gt; projects were fairly easy to optimize, so they were stress-free;
I look forward to more challenges like this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see the results of my time at the gym! I can feel my posture improving and I am less tired after working all day.
If you have not hit the gym, try taking a run! A 10-minute jog is just as refreshing :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are not a fad. Blockchains like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ethereum.org/en/&quot;&gt;Etherum&lt;/a&gt; already proved that they work as a decentralized financial system.
However, there are other applications. Bleeding edge protocols like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; allow you to store and serve files on demand and are
completely fault-proof. It is bringing about the widespread adoption of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b&quot;&gt;web 3.0&lt;/a&gt;, where the internet is
completely decentralized. Don’t miss out. If you would like an awesome primer on blockchains, I linked a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw&quot;&gt;3 Blue 1 Brown&lt;/a&gt; video for you to check out!&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week, I managed to cook some new recipes I learnt from my mother. Most of those are curries and frys like
tomato curry, potato curry, chicken curry, potato fry, egg fry, etc. I hope that once I get comfortable with
making these I do not have to stress about food for the rest of the semester, although they do take a bit of time to
make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also practiced some coding problems and finished the HackerRank for project Collatz!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in your way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress of applying for internships is definetly taking its toll on me. I sit down to start working only to get hit
by the realization that still need to apply. It is hard to get anything done with a cloud hanging over my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will you do next week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start going to some org meetings that I think are cool, cook more instead of eating out, and try to
finish all my class work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #2: Makefile?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The makefile looked pretty standard compared to makefiles from other projects, but having aliases for batch git
commands seems unecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Makefiles are pretty neat tools that allow you to write pipelines for compiling or testing code.
However, they seem pretty complicated to work with and simply annotating a makefile is not enough to learn it.
I hope we go over how a makefile works in lecture soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your experience of assertions, unit tests, and coverage? (this question will vary, week to week)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assertions&lt;/em&gt; are statements in your code that check if a boolean expression is true or not and fail immediately if false.
They allow you to test invariants in an algorithm and I use them in every project I work on. I cannot quantify how
many bugs I caught early on due to assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;em&gt;Unit Testing&lt;/em&gt; before and I think it works very well for this project. The input and output are
well-defined and creating more tests is very simple. However, it does require you to know the solution ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never used &lt;em&gt;Coverage&lt;/em&gt; before and am not sure it is needed for this project. I believe it is only useful in checking
if your tests are reaching every part of your codebase - best used for very large projects that many have
dead code that does not need to be maintained. All in all, I think this is the least useful tool of the three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been going to the gym with my roomates and I noticed some changes! I think my hard work is starting to pay off
now that my posture and strength has improved. Here is to maintiaing my routine into the semester!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember taking Operating Systems (CS439)? Remember how hard it was to fix race conditions, memory leaks, and null
pointers? Well, it could have been all avoided if you used a new programming paradigm. Introducing
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;, a programming language that does not even allow you to write such code.
It separates references into mutable and immutable references so that
&lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ownership-rules&quot;&gt;you can only have one mutable reference of an object at a time&lt;/a&gt;.
This already avoids problems with multiple threads writing to a single memory address.
It also has something called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html&quot;&gt;borrow checker&lt;/a&gt;
that makes sure all references are accounted for so you will not reference deallocated memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to check it out, you can find resources &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/learn&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and try running some
code in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;online playground&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[CS373 Fall 2021: Taraka Pranav Rayudu]]></title><description><![CDATA[Where did you grow up? I spent the first half of my life in Bangalore, India. After I turned 13, my parents decided to move to the

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where did you grow up?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first half of my life in Bangalore, India. After I turned 13, my parents decided to move to the
States, so I moved to San Antonio, Texas where I entered middle school at 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade.
Three years later, I moved to Dallas, TX where I completed high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What high school did you attend?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent my freshman year at Ronald Reagan High School in San Antonio and sophomore through senior years at Keller High
School in Keller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found our newly minted Robotics club to be the best extracurricular I participated in. We had a humble
yet ambitious atmosphere as we competed among thousands (3,790, to be exact) of other teams in the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc&quot;&gt;FIRST Robotics competition&lt;/a&gt;. We were not allowed to work on the robot after
a certain date so every regional event started off with me uploading new, untested code into the robot followed by near
complete failure and a melt-down in the entire team. Atleast it taught me the importance of writing bulletproof code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you come to UT?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UT is hands-down one of the best universities for Computer Science in the United States, so that made choosing UT very
obvious from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why are you majoring in CS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up code when found a YouTube channel called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman&quot;&gt;The Coding Train&lt;/a&gt; where
a professor named &lt;a href=&quot;https://shiffman.net/&quot;&gt;Daniel Shiffman&lt;/a&gt; made generative art using a javascript graphics library
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/&quot;&gt;p5.js&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually I landed on the engineering side of CS and started practicing
problem-solving and making web apps and lo and behold… I am now a CS major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why are you in this class?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard this class was a classic, must-take for a CS major at UT, so I wanted to see what it was about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are your expectations of this class?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to become proficient at writing software in large teams and know how to use all relevant tooling for such large
teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How much Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming do you already know?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fairly proficient in javascript and web programming since I picked those up early in high school. I use Python for
some of my projects and I used SQL for my past internship, so I have a some exposure to all these languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you like the first lectures?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best parts of lecture was using the versatility of Ed Discussion to ask questions in class and using a git repo
for lecture notes. I do wish it was more fast-paced though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you feel about the cold calling?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fine with it, but I need a couple of seconds before talking in front of the whole class and I am afraid of not
being able to unmute myself or having some other technical issue on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What made you happy this week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a new bike to commute to campus and it works perfectly! I have even ridden to downtown Austin with it and
it is overall a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/papers/robogrammar/index.html&quot;&gt;RoboGrammar&lt;/a&gt; is a 2020 MIT paper which describes a
graph-based approach to generate robot structures like body joints and links. Basically, they describe a way to
generate graphs that can be turned into robots that are optimized for smooth surfaces, stepped surfaces, etc.
It is cool because even with a few nodes, you can generate a huge variety of robots. Here is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/papers/robogrammar/paper.pdf&quot;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; and

I even a linked a quick video down below for you :).&lt;/p&gt;
