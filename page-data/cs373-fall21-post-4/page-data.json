I think a change in setting is very important for me to stay productive.</p>\n<p>I also participate in UT Programming Contest (<a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/utpc/%5D\">UTPC</a>) this past friday and\nit was a lot of fun but the food ran out before I got to it :(</p>\n<h3>What’s in your way?</h3>\n<p>I need to find more recipes to make so I can eat regularly and stay healthy. I am thinking of trying out stir-fry\nrecipes from Ghenghis Grill make-your-own bowl cards since I’ve always liked the taste. I will let you know how\nit tastes!</p>\n<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>\n<p>Continue making good progress on my homework and working on work.</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #4: What Happens to Us?</h3>\n<p>I thought that, like all articles I read on this topic, it is something I have to take to heart. As a boy, I\ncan only imagine how unfair the situation can feel for women and I want to be proactive to avoid these issues in my\nworkplace. For that, I am grateful for gaining another perspective and I hope to discuss how to solve these\nproblems with my peers.</p>\n<h3>What was your experience of Collatz, exceptions, and types?</h3>\n<p>Collatz was easy and I already knew the content for exceptions and types. It feels like it should just take an hour to\nlearn a week’s worth of lectures, so it is hard to care about lectures.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>I like how productive I have become after I commit to finishing some task when I start it. It made my weekend stress-free\nand I was able to hang out with friends and have fun!</p>\n<h3>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p>My friend made a cool browser extension to track your internship applications for you! It is called\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/status-fyi/bihdcfkeidcjljeffcccehdlkplibmoj\">Status.fyi</a> and it automatically\nkeeps track of the companies you applied to and lets you update where you are in the process. Everyone’s information\nis pooled together to display aggregate application data for tons of companies. Be sure to give it a try!</p>\n<p>Until next week!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 4","date":"September 19, 2021","description":"Post #4 for CS375 Software Enginering (What Happened to Us?)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 3"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 5"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1581867e-edf1-556e-8b05-6ee827c1149f","previousPostId":"9051a702-a315-527a-b027-5fa220cefc6d","nextPostId":"07e01c78-161f-540c-8dd8-109a9fd69304"}},
