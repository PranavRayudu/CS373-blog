I am working on the frontend site, so I spent\nsome time researching the different frameworks and seeing how they feel.</p>\n<h3>What’s in your way?</h3>\n<p>The weather. It has always been the weather. I and my roommate got stuck the first time it rained in forever\non Tuesday, and now I carry a raincoat with me everywhere. It is a risk to go out during an overcast day,\nwhere legions of raindrops await their impending assault on unprepared pedestrians. Be sure to carry an umbrella!</p>\n<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>\n<p>Crunch out web pages like a madman and avoid the rain. I want our website to look cool and modern so I am taking\nthe time to experiment. I also do not want to get wet. These will be my primary directives for the rest of the week.</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of Paper #6: The Single Responsibility Principle?</h3>\n<p>The paper was a good read about organizing our code and I really appreciate how it is well-timed for each\nphase of our project.</p>\n<h3>What was your experience of factorial, reduce, and operators?</h3>\n<p>I have not used <code class=\"language-text\">reduce</code> before but it is a neat trick that I hope to use sometime in the future, whether\nit be for a coding interview or for a python project. I look forward to learning more of these higher-order\nfunctions that can speed up code development.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>This week’s UTPC competition was fun! I managed to snag food, a shirt, and a water bottle. I look forward to\ngetting more swag and completing problems in the future!</p>\n<h3>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides\">UT Night Ride</a>! Every month, you get $100 of Lyft credits.\nThese credits can be used to go to your apartment past 12:00am and I have used them many times to study late on campus.\nAlthough they can only be used when you are on campus, there is a region in west-campus that counts as on-campus\nbecause it has university housing. I have attached a map of the coverage area below. have fun and stay safe!</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1O54ZDsUp3wYWv03udV2Gei45fvU65hiG\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>Until next week!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 6","date":"October 02, 2021","description":"Post #6 for CS375 Software Engineering (The Single Responsibility Principle)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 5"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"277af4b3-2de8-5c7e-be60-96826f2c1705","previousPostId":"07e01c78-161f-540c-8dd8-109a9fd69304","nextPostId":null}},
