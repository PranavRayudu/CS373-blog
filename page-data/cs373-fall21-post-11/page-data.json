I must make\ngood progress on SWE phase III though.</p>\n<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>\n<p>I will add filters and proper pagination and sorting and all sorts of eye candy to my SWE website. I hope\nthat this phase goes more smoothly than the other phases since they were pretty rough towards the end.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I probably ate the sugar output of an entire sugar field in sweets during this weekend so I will stay as\nhealthy as possible this week.</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #11: Getters and Setters?</h3>\n<p>The paper is rather basic in my opinion since it can be summarized in a few sentences. No doubt I agree\nthat getters and setters are the banes of the OOP design pattern, but I caught that fairly early in my\nprogramming career and I am sure others are aware of the anti-pattern already.</p>\n<h3>What was your experience of relational algebra, select, and project?</h3>\n<p>I am already familiar with relational algebra and the select/project statement because I have used it in\nmy internship and past projects. I anticipate no friction in learning how they will be used in this class\nor our SWE project.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>I went back home for Diwali! I lit candles and Diya lamps to celebrate the occasion and\njust relaxed at home. I also got to attend my high school robotics teamâ€™s regional competition for the fall season and\ncatch up with my old engineering teachers. My team won regionals by a large margin!\nYou can find their website <a href=\"https://kcalrobotics.weebly.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Whatâ€™s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p>The SWE project requires that your website is mobile responsive, and you should test your SWE frontend on a real phone.\nTo do that, add <code class=\"language-text\">HOST=0.0.0.0</code> to your frontendâ€™s\n<code class=\"language-text\">.env</code> file or replace <code class=\"language-text\">\"start\": \"react-scripts start\"</code> with <code class=\"language-text\">\"start\": \"HOST=0.0.0.0 react-scripts start\"</code> in\nyour <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code>. Next time you run <code class=\"language-text\">npm start</code>, you will see that your react project is hosted on <code class=\"language-text\">192.168.x.xx:xxxx</code>\ninstead of <code class=\"language-text\">localhost:xxxx</code>. Open this same link on your mobile phone to see your website!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: Your phone and computer need to be on the same local network to communicate together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Until next week!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 11","date":"November 07, 2021","description":"Post #11 for CS375 Software Engineering (Getters and Setters)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 10"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"4afbb55b-2680-5338-8493-2d5be0e7e4fd","previousPostId":"b3486f49-91ef-561b-9652-b7db21b131bf","nextPostId":null}},
