Most of those are curries and frys like\ntomato curry, potato curry, chicken curry, potato fry, egg fry, etc. I hope that once I get comfortable with\nmaking these I do not have to stress about food for the rest of the semester, although they do take a bit of time to\nmake.</p>\n<p>I also practiced some coding problems and finished the HackerRank for project Collatz!</p>\n<h3>What’s in your way?</h3>\n<p>The stress of applying for internships is definetly taking its toll on me. I sit down to start working only to get hit\nby the realization that still need to apply. It is hard to get anything done with a cloud hanging over my head.</p>\n<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>\n<p>I will start going to some org meetings that I think are cool, cook more instead of eating out, and try to\nfinish all my class work.</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #2: Makefile?</h3>\n<p>The makefile looked pretty standard compared to makefiles from other projects, but having aliases for batch git\ncommands seems unecessary.</p>\n<p>I think Makefiles are pretty neat tools that allow you to write pipelines for compiling or testing code.\nHowever, they seem pretty complicated to work with and simply annotating a makefile is not enough to learn it.\nI hope we go over how a makefile works in lecture soon.</p>\n<h3>What was your experience of assertions, unit tests, and coverage? (this question will vary, week to week)</h3>\n<p><em>Assertions</em> are statements in your code that check if a boolean expression is true or not and fail immediately if false.\nThey allow you to test invariants in an algorithm and I use them in every project I work on. I cannot quantify how\nmany bugs I caught early on due to assertions.</p>\n<p>I have used <em>Unit Testing</em> before and I think it works very well for this project. The input and output are\nwell-defined and creating more tests is very simple. However, it does require you to know the solution ahead of time.</p>\n<p>I have never used <em>Coverage</em> before and am not sure it is needed for this project. I believe it is only useful in checking\nif your tests are reaching every part of your codebase - best used for very large projects that many have\ndead code that does not need to be maintained. All in all, I think this is the least useful tool of the three.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>I have been going to the gym with my roomates and I noticed some changes! I think my hard work is starting to pay off\nnow that my posture and strength has improved. Here is to maintiaing my routine into the semester!</p>\n<h3>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p>Remember taking Operating Systems (CS439)? Remember how hard it was to fix race conditions, memory leaks, and null\npointers? Well, it could have been all avoided if you used a new programming paradigm. Introducing\n<a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a>, a programming language that does not even allow you to write such code.\nIt separates references into mutable and immutable references so that\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ownership-rules\">you can only have one mutable reference of an object at a time</a>.\nThis already avoids problems with multiple threads writing to a single memory address.\nIt also has something called a <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html\">borrow checker</a>\nthat makes sure all references are accounted for so you will not reference deallocated memory.</p>\n<p>If you want to check it out, you can find resources <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/learn\">here</a> and try running some\ncode in the <a href=\"https://play.rust-lang.org/\">online playground</a>.</p>\n<p>Until next week!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"CS373 Fall 2021 Post 2","date":"September 05, 2021","description":"Post #2 for CS375 Software Enginering (Makefiles)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CS373 Fall 2021: Taraka Pranav Rayudu"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"aca27aa2-fd4b-57a4-a67d-c631791c1999","previousPostId":"7c4eab48-c0aa-51fa-a6fa-ed11a4f27151","nextPostId":null}},
