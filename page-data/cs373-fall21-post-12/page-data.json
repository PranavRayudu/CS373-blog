I brought back more clothes for the winter, bathroom supplies, and a heck-ton of food, resulting in a pretty easy week. I also enjoyed my experiment noodle-chicken bowls using the recipe cards I snagged from Genghis Grill. If you ever go there, I recommend the <em>Spicy Chicken Korean Bowl</em> from the <em>Make Your Own Bowl</em> option.</p>\n<h3>What’s in your way?</h3>\n<p>I have 1 project due on Sunday and 3 projects, 1 exam due on Monday. That basically involves every class I am taking this semester… I do not even need to describe the size of my backlog.</p>\n<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>\n<p>Next week will be my last week on campus before Thanksgiving so I will try to enjoy it the best I can with my friends. I also think the visualization requirement of Phase IV is the most interesting part of the project so I will start experimenting with 3D globe libraries.</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #12: More Getters and Setters?</h3>\n<p>The paper “More Getters and Setters”, although useful, added a lot less to the conversation about getters and setters than the original paper. I wish we learned a new design paradigm or pattern that we can use in future projects.</p>\n<h3>What was your experience of cross join, theta join, natural join, and SQL?</h3>\n<p>Although I have used SQL before, I am new to relational algebra and cross-join, theta-join, and natural-join terms. I implicitly used them in various SQL statements though.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>I am excited about going back for thanksgiving more than anything that happened this week honestly. I have too much work to feel happy about my prospects right now.</p>\n<h3>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.utrecsports.org/facilities/facility/caven-lacrosse-and-sports-center-at-clark-field\">Clark Field</a> is an awesome on-campus sports field that has a Soccer / Ultimate Frisbee / Lacrosse Field, Jogging track, Basketball courts, monkey bars, etc. that make it an excellent sports facility.
