Oh, and I\nalso joined Intramural Soccer âš½! We had our first weekly match on Wednesday and it was an absolute blast.\nWe lost but I know we will win the next one.</p>\n<h3>Whatâ€™s in your way?</h3>\n<p>My SWE project is still far from complete and I and my teammates are still wrangling the\nmonster that is scraping data so that we can finish in time. I would like to finish\nadding all this data to the front-end as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>\n<p>I will finish my SWE project, start running outside and practice for my next IM soccer match.</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #9: Interface Segregation Principle?</h3>\n<p>ISP is a good primer on the motivations behind having interfaces and multiple inheritances.\nI think multiple inheritances reign far above other object models and I wish it were the\nnorm instead of regular inheritance. Either way, I look forward to using it in my projects!</p>\n<h3>What were your experience of functions, closures, and decorators?</h3>\n<p>For a long time, I looked forward to learning about closures and decorators so I am glad we\nfinally hit this topic. They occurred in multiple places during my coding career like\nFlask/backend API frameworks, Python <code class=\"language-text\">functools</code>, etc. Since they are paramount for so many\ncomplex libraries, I am glad that I gained familiarity with these tools.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>Honestly, I am more excited about next weekâ€¦ itâ€™s Halloween ðŸŽƒ! Lots of celebration and themed\nparties to visit and it heralds the beginning of end-of-year festivities. Cheers!</p>\n<h3>Whatâ€™s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p>If you live off-campus, then you might live near an <a href=\"https://austin.bcycle.com/\">Austin Bike Share</a> bike rack.\nBike share lets you rent a bike from any metro bike rack, which is available on and near UT campus\n(see a <a href=\"https://austin.bcycle.com/stations\">map of all bike racks</a>).\nThe best thing is, UT students can get an annual membership for $12 after signing up\n<a href=\"https://austin.bcycle.com/university-of-texas-at-austin\">on this form</a>!\nYou can find more info <a href=\"https://parking.utexas.edu/bcycle\">on the UT website</a>.</p>\n<p>Until next week!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 9","date":"October 24, 2021","description":"Post #9 for CS375 Software Engineering (Interface Segregation Principle)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-8/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 8"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"9f76190d-e53e-5ff7-800a-7eb8e47eaaf4","previousPostId":"2877aa18-dee9-5ecb-a559-b2dcd8d6daa0","nextPostId":null}},
