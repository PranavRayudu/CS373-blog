As a result, my next week has become very chill and I plan on enjoying my days back home.</p>\n<h3>What’s in your way?</h3>\n<p>I do not have much in my way because of how brutal this past week has been. I look forward to having an easy week and spending time with family for Thanksgiving.</p>\n<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>\n<p>I am going back to my family on Monday for Thanksgiving and will stay in Dallas for the next week. I am not sure if Black Friday deals will be as exciting this year, but I want to walk around the displays with my friends and just hang out out this Friday.</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #13: Why Extends Is Evil?</h3>\n<p>I have waited a long time for “Why Extends is Evil” because I too independently recognized the problem with having classical inheritance in a language. I think that the “extends” operator made sense when languages like Java were being made because it was important to reuse existing code and inheritance made that possible. However, millions of people develop code now and extends is not flexible enough.</p>\n<h3>What was your experience of SQL?</h3>\n<p>I think SQL is a completely different way to code because it is not Turing complete and has a different model for storing data. I think it is important to understand this relational algebra and the algorithms behind it though.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>I hung out with my friends every day this weekend so I am very happy about that.</p>\n<h3>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p>Have fun for Thanksgiving.</p>\n<p>Until next week!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 13","date":"November 21, 2021","description":"Post #13 for CS375 Software Engineering (Why Extends Is Evil)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 12"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"40d28acb-d324-5b4d-8108-2aa36f7aa512","previousPostId":"a2f2254d-130b-5e8c-bd5b-a6f82181506b","nextPostId":null}},
