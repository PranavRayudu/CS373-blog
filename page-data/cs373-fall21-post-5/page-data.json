I will also start running this week because the weather has\ncalmed down.</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #5: Pair Programming?</h3>\n<p>The paper is a good primer on working with your fellow peers, although every\nstudent experienced enough to take SWE knows the principles. Regardless, I am\nconvinced that all code should be written in pairs. Well, maybe not individual assignments.</p>\n<h3>What was your experience of Python’s object model, list, tuple, set, dict, and iterators?</h3>\n<p>I have used the Python object model and the other data structures in my projects before, so\nthey are nothing new, but I appreciate the refresher. I am looking forward to learning\nmore complex python concepts like decorators, closures, etc. that can use in my SWE project.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>I had a lot of fun this weekend hanging out with all my friends. We did not do anything special\nother than just going out, watching a movie, etc. but I liked seeing so many of my friends\nand it was energizing.</p>\n<p>Also, the weather was perfect for the first time in forever! On Friday I sat on the benches\nin front of Greg and worked, which was very satisfying.</p>\n<h3>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p>I find stretching my legs after walking all day very satisfying.\nMy favorites stretches are the <a href=\"https://www.openfit.com/figure-4-stretch\">Figure Four stretch</a>,\n<a href=\"https://yoga15.com/pose/runners-lunge/\">Runner’s Lunge</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://www.sensational-yoga-poses.com/hamstring-stretches.html#pyramidpose\">Kneeling hamstring stretch</a>\nfor my legs, and <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/the-towel-chest-stretch-2696334\">Towel Chest stretch</a> for the upper body.\nYou should hold them for 30 to 60s and lean in slowly and lean as far into the stretch as you can. Even better,\nthey are all progressive stretches so you can start slow notice yourself getting better over time!</p>\n<p>Until next week!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 5","date":"September 26, 2021","description":"Post #5 for CS375 Software Engineering (Pair Programming)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-4/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 4"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-6/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 6"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"07e01c78-161f-540c-8dd8-109a9fd69304","previousPostId":"1581867e-edf1-556e-8b05-6ee827c1149f","nextPostId":"277af4b3-2de8-5c7e-be60-96826f2c1705"}},
