We pulled through after the 1-day extension, which gave us just enough time to\ncomplete all the requirements towards the climactic final hours. I also celebrated my friend’s birthday and\nfinished participating in <a href=\"https://hacktx.com/\">HackTX 2021</a>. I am completely famished after working for 24hrs,\nbut we won 3rd place for best blockchain project which you should check out\n<a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/bitsnacks?ref_content=my-projects-tab&#x26;ref_feature=my_projects\">here</a>!</p>\n<h3>What’s in your way?</h3>\n<p>I have a massive backlog of work to do that I will get started on right after typing up this blog post. I have to\nfinish my neural nets assignment, grade assignments, and prepare for interviews this week.</p>\n<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>\n<p>I will start on phase III and spend more time with my friends. I think we all agree that we need to make\ntime in our busy schedules to meet each other and have fun.</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #10: Dependency Inversion Principle?</h3>\n<p>The Dependency Inversion Principle is an important general idea that I learned via trial and error. I think\nevery programmer can agree that a well-designed software project takes the DIP into account.</p>\n<h3>What was your experience of =, *, ** and regular expressions?</h3>\n<p>I think destructing is a complicated but very useful topic in Python. I see it used very frequently in\nmachine learning libraries like PyTorch and Keras to make syntax clean.\nMoreover, I have lots of experience with regular expressions and use them frequently when editing\ncode or formatting files.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>Getting together with my friends to celebrate a birthday and winning something for HackTX was the climax\nof my past few weeks. I want to make sure the rest of my weeks are just as awesome as Halloween weekend!</p>\n<h3>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p>For anyone interested in Blockchain or cryptocurrencies, <a href=\"https://txblockchain.org/\">Texas Blockchain</a> is\na UT org dedicated to the technical and financial side of cryptos. You can join their discord\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/rHEDeqrgQR\">here</a> and they generally hold informational meetings and technical workshops on\nWed and Thurs 6-7 pm in CBA 4.328.</p>\n<p>Until next week!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 10","date":"October 31, 2021","description":"Post #10 for CS375 Software Engineering (Dependency Inversion Principle)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-9/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 9"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-11/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 11"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b3486f49-91ef-561b-9652-b7db21b131bf","previousPostId":"9f76190d-e53e-5ff7-800a-7eb8e47eaaf4","nextPostId":"4afbb55b-2680-5338-8493-2d5be0e7e4fd"}},
