After I turned 13, my parents decided to move to the\nStates, so I moved to San Antonio, Texas where I entered middle school at 7<sup>th</sup> grade.\nThree years later, I moved to Dallas, TX where I completed high school.</p>\n<h3>What high school did you attend?</h3>\n<p>I spent my freshman year at Ronald Reagan High School in San Antonio and sophomore through senior years at Keller High\nSchool in Keller.</p>\n<h3>What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?</h3>\n<p>I found our newly minted Robotics club to be the best extracurricular I participated in. We had a humble\nyet ambitious atmosphere as we competed among thousands (3,790, to be exact) of other teams in the\n<a href=\"https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc\">FIRST Robotics competition</a>. We were not allowed to work on the robot after\na certain date so every regional event started off with me uploading new, untested code into the robot followed by near\ncomplete failure and a melt-down in the entire team. Atleast it taught me the importance of writing bulletproof code.</p>\n<h3>Why did you come to UT?</h3>\n<p>UT is hands-down one of the best universities for Computer Science in the United States, so that made choosing UT very\nobvious from the get-go.</p>\n<h3>Why are you majoring in CS?</h3>\n<p>I picked up code when found a YouTube channel called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman\">The Coding Train</a> where\na professor named <a href=\"https://shiffman.net/\">Daniel Shiffman</a> made generative art using a javascript graphics library\ncalled <a href=\"https://p5js.org/\">p5.js</a>. Eventually I landed on the engineering side of CS and started practicing\nproblem-solving and making web apps and lo and behold… I am now a CS major.</p>\n<h3>Why are you in this class?</h3>\n<p>I heard this class was a classic, must-take for a CS major at UT, so I wanted to see what it was about.</p>\n<h3>What are your expectations of this class?</h3>\n<p>I hope to become proficient at writing software in large teams and know how to use all relevant tooling for such large\nteams.</p>\n<h3>How much Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming do you already know?</h3>\n<p>I am fairly proficient in javascript and web programming since I picked those up early in high school. I use Python for\nsome of my projects and I used SQL for my past internship, so I have a some exposure to all these languages.</p>\n<h3>How did you like the first lectures?</h3>\n<p>The best parts of lecture was using the versatility of Ed Discussion to ask questions in class and using a git repo\nfor lecture notes. I do wish it was more fast-paced though.</p>\n<h3>How did you feel about the cold calling?</h3>\n<p>I am fine with it, but I need a couple of seconds before talking in front of the whole class and I am afraid of not\nbeing able to unmute myself or having some other technical issue on the spot.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>I bought a new bike to commute to campus and it works perfectly! I have even ridden to downtown Austin with it and\nit is overall a lot of fun.</p>\n<h3>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/papers/robogrammar/index.html\">RoboGrammar</a> is a 2020 MIT paper which describes a\ngraph-based approach to generate robot structures like body joints and links. Basically, they describe a way to\ngenerate graphs that can be turned into robots that are optimized for smooth surfaces, stepped surfaces, etc.\nIt is cool because even with a few nodes, you can generate a huge variety of robots.
