We had a small hiccup with our Gitlab issues on the last day but\nwe managed to get it working on production. I had fun with friends and took it easy this week.</p>\n<h3>What’s in your way?</h3>\n<p>I have a few pending and future interviews that I need to get through. I hope to do a good job on them!</p>\n<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>\n<p>Phase II! My team has started working on phase II and I think it will be a good one. In this phase, we are using\nlinters, formatters, and issue boards to organize our code and work. Now that we are following all the suggestions\nprovided to us, this phase should go smoothly.</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of Paper #7: Open-Closed Principle?</h3>\n<p>The Open-Closed principle is important to teach students but I honestly think it needs to be gained from experience.\nOne of the interesting comments I saw mentioned that students do not understand this because school projects only run\n1-2 weeks long and the Open-Closed principle is not so useful. It is more useful on longer, semester-long projects.</p>\n<h3>What was your experience of operators, and iteration?</h3>\n<p>As Dr. Downing said, Python has meticulously designed functionality for operators and iteration, although I think they\nare fairly simple.</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>Such favorable weather! Sometimes I would walk out of class and just stand in the middle of Speedway because the\ntemperature, lighting, and wind were just right. The last time I was able to do this on campus was freshman year, so it\nbrings back memories.</p>\n<h3>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p>Go out y’all. During the evenings (around 5-6pm), the weather will be perfect for a walk outside or to just study. I\nrecommend sitting by the benches in front of Greg or the green plaza behind Jester Center because they are excellent\nstudying spots. Otherwise, take a walk down San Jacinto Boulevard which runs along Waller Creek if you just need\nto chill!</p>\n<p>Until next week!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 7","date":"October 10, 2021","description":"Post #7 for CS375 Software Engineering (The Open-Closed Principle)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-6/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 6"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"c7ca876d-05ea-5d29-bcf6-2e0476482def","previousPostId":"277af4b3-2de8-5c7e-be60-96826f2c1705","nextPostId":null}},
