While it is\nimportant to step away from work and take a break, I find that I use distractions to avoid stress. Instead,\nI should plan out my day so I can work and get everything done.</p>\n<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>\n<p>I will start implementing time-saving strategies like tracking time spent on projects, allocating fixed time per project,\nand making sure I get something done every time I sit down to work. The idea is if I plan out when I will take breaks,\nI will not feel like taking breaks all the time.</p>\n<p>Oh, and career fair is coming up. I also plan on visiting some exciting companies and introducing myself\nto their recruiters. I hope to see you all there!</p>\n<h3>If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #3: Continuous Integration?</h3>\n<p>While it does a good job of introducing the philosophy of CI development, that paper was written in 2006 and it shows.</p>\n<p>It uses arcane references (CruiseControl, Subversion, FIT, etc.) for tools no longer used, but I was hoping to learn\nabout modern tools (Git, CircleCI, Github Actions, etc.) and how software teams take advantage of\ntheir capability and robustness.</p>\n<h3>What was your experience of IsPrime and Collatz optimizations?</h3>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">IsPrime</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Collatz</code> projects were fairly easy to optimize, so they were stress-free;\nI look forward to more challenges like this!</p>\n<h3>What made you happy this week?</h3>\n<p>I can see the results of my time at the gym! I can feel my posture improving and I am less tired after working all day.\nIf you have not hit the gym, try taking a run! A 10 minute jog is just as refreshing :)</p>\n<h3>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>\n<p>Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are not a fad. Blockchains like <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/\">Bitcoin</a> and\n<a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\">Etherum</a> already proved that that they work as a decentralized financial system.\nHowever, there are other applications. Bleading edge protocols like\n<a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\">IPFS</a> allow you to store and serve files on demand and\ncompletely fault-proof. It is bringing about the widespread adoption of\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b\">web 3.0</a>, where the internet is\ncompletely decentralized. Don’t miss out. If you would like an awesome primer on blockchains, I linked a\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw\">3 Blue 1 Brown</a> video for you to check out!</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bBC-nXj3Ng4?controls=0\" title=\"3B1B Bitcoin video\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope;\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>Until next week!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Software Engineering: Post 3","date":"September 11, 2021","description":"Post #3 for CS375 Software Enginering (Continuous Integration)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs373-fall21-post-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CS373 Fall 2021 Post 2"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"9051a702-a315-527a-b027-5fa220cefc6d","previousPostId":"aca27aa2-fd4b-57a4-a67d-c631791c1999","nextPostId":null}},
