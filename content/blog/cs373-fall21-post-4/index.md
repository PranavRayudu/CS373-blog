### What did you do this past week?
I got my study habits in order and made big leaps in productivity by timing how long it takes to complete each task 
and going to different places to study! I think a change in setting is very important for me to stay productive.

I also participate in UT Programming Contest ([UTPC](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/utpc/])) this past friday and
it was a lot of fun but the food ran out before I got to it :(

### What's in your way?
I need to find more recipes to make so I can eat regularly and stay healthy. I am thinking of trying out stir-fry 
recipes from Ghenghis Grill make-your-own bowl cards since I've always liked the taste. I will let you know how 
it tastes!

### What will you do next week?
Continue making good progress on my homework and working on work.

### If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #4: What Happens to Us?
I thought that, like all articles I read on this topic, it is something I have to take to heart. As a boy, I
can only imagine how unfair the situation can feel for women and I want to be proactive to avoid these issues in my
workplace. For that, I am grateful for gaining another perspective and I hope to discuss how to solve these 
problems with my peers.

### What was your experience of Collatz, exceptions, and types?
Collatz was easy and I already knew the content for exceptions and types. It feels like it should just take an hour to 
learn a week's worth of lectures, so it is hard to care about lectures.

### What made you happy this week?
I like how productive I have become after I commit to finishing some task when I start it. It made my weekend stress-free
and I was able to hang out with friends and have fun!

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My friend made a cool browser extension to track your internship applications for you! It is called 
[Status.fyi](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/status-fyi/bihdcfkeidcjljeffcccehdlkplibmoj) and it automatically
keeps track of the companies you applied to and lets you update where you are in the process. Everyone's information 
is pooled together to display aggregate application data for tons of companies. Be sure to give it a try!

Until next week!
