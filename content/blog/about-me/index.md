### Where did you grow up?
I spent the first half of my life in Bangalore, India. After I turned 13, my parents decided to move to the 
States, so I moved to San Antonio, Texas where I entered middle school at 7<sup>th</sup> grade.
Three years later, I moved to Dallas, TX where I completed high school. 

### What high school did you attend?
I spent my freshman year at Ronald Reagan High School in San Antonio and sophomore through senior years at Keller High 
School in Keller.

### What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?
I found our newly minted Robotics club to be the best extracurricular I participated in. We had a humble 
yet ambitious atmosphere as we competed among thousands (3,790, to be exact) of other teams in the 
[FIRST Robotics competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc). We were not allowed to work on the robot after
a certain date so every regional event started off with me uploading new, untested code into the robot followed by near
complete failure and a melt-down in the entire team. I usually fixed this pretty quickly, but it taught me the 
importance of writing bulletproof code.

### Why did you come to UT?
UT is hands-down one of the best universities for Computer Science in the United States, so that made choosing UT very 
obvious from the get-go. 

### Why are you majoring in CS?
I picked up code when found a YouTube channel called [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) where 
a professor named [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/) made generative art using a javascript graphics library 
called [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Eventually I landed on the engineering side of CS and started practicing 
problem-solving and making web apps and lo and behold... I am now a CS major. 

### Why are you in this class?
I heard this class was a classic, must-take for a CS major at UT, so I wanted to see what it was about.

### What are your expectations of this class?
I hope to become proficient at writing software in large teams and know how to use all relevant tooling for such large 
teams.

### How much Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming do you already know?
I am fairly proficient in javascript and web programming since I picked those up early in high school. I use Python for 
some of my projects and I used SQL for my past internship, so I have a some exposure to all these languages.

### How did you like the first lectures?
The best parts of lecture was using the versatility of Ed Discussion to ask questions in class and using a git repo 
for lecture notes. I do wish it was more fast-paced though.

### How did you feel about the cold calling?
I am fine with it, but I need a couple of seconds before talking in front of the whole class and I am afraid not being 
able to unmute myself or having some other technical issue on the spot.

### What made you happy this week?
I bought a new bike to commute to campus and it works perfectly! I have even ridden to downtown Austin with it and
it is overall a lot of fun.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
[RoboGrammar](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/papers/robogrammar/index.html) is a 2020 MIT paper which describes a 
graph-based approach to generate robot structures like body joints and links. Basically, they describe a way to 
generate graphs that can be turned into robots that are optimized for smooth surfaces, stepped surfaces, etc. 
It is cool because even with a few nodes, you can generate a huge variety of robots. Here is 
[the paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/papers/robogrammar/paper.pdf) and 
[source code](https://github.com/allanzhao/RoboGrammar/) if you want to check it out. 
I even a linked a quick video down below for you :).
