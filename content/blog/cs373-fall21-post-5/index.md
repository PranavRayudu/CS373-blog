### What did you do this past week?
I 

### What's in your way?
My SWE group needs to finish up our project proposal and I hope we can get it too soon. 

### What will you do next week?
Hit the ground running on Project #2 and get a mockup of our project and the 14 pages up as soon as possible. 

### If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #5: Pair Programming?
The paper is a good primer on working with your fellow peers, although every
student experienced enough to take SWE knows the principles. Regardless, I am totally convinced that 
all code should be written in pairs. Well, maybe not individual assignments.

### What was your experience of Python's object model, list, tuple, set, dict, and iterators?
I have used the Python object model and the other data structures in my projects before, so 
they are nothing new, but I appreciate the refresher. I am looking forward to learning 
more complex python concepts like decorators, closures, etc. that can use in my SWE project.

### What made you happy this week?


### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?


Until next week!
