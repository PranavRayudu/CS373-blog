### What did you do this past week?
I worked on work, worked out, and did coding interviews from different companies I applied to.

### What's in your way?
I and my SWE group need to finish up our project proposal and I hope we can get it done soon. 

### What will you do next week?
Hit the ground running on Project #2 and get a mockup of our project and the 14 pages 
up as soon as possible. I will also start running this week because the weather has
calmed down.

### If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #5: Pair Programming?
The paper is a good primer on working with your fellow peers, although every
student experienced enough to take SWE knows the principles. Regardless, I am 
convinced that all code should be written in pairs. Well, maybe not individual assignments.

### What was your experience of Python's object model, list, tuple, set, dict, and iterators?
I have used the Python object model and the other data structures in my projects before, so 
they are nothing new, but I appreciate the refresher. I am looking forward to learning 
more complex python concepts like decorators, closures, etc. that can use in my SWE project.

### What made you happy this week?
I had a lot of fun this weekend hanging out with all my friends. We did not do anything special
other than just going out, watching a movie, etc. but I liked seeing so many of my friends
and it was energizing.

Also, the weather was perfect for the first time in forever! On Friday I sat on the benches 
in front of Greg and worked, which was very satisfying.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I find stretching my legs after walking all day very satisfying.
My favorites stretches are the [Figure Four stretch](https://www.openfit.com/figure-4-stretch), 
[Runner's Lunge](https://yoga15.com/pose/runners-lunge/),
and [Kneeling hamstring stretch](https://www.sensational-yoga-poses.com/hamstring-stretches.html#pyramidpose) 
for my legs, and [Towel Chest stretch](https://www.verywellfit.com/the-towel-chest-stretch-2696334) for the upper body. 
You should hold them for 30 to 60s and lean in slowly and lean as far into the stretch as you can. Even better, 
they are all progressive stretches so you can start slow notice yourself getting better over time!

Until next week!
