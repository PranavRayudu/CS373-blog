### What did you do this past week?
I started working on project #2 and I like how it is going so far. I am working on the frontend site, so I spent
some time researching the different frameworks and seeing how they feel.

### What's in your way?
The weather. It has always been the weather. I and my roommate got stuck the first time it rained in forever
on Tuesday, and now I carry a raincoat with me everywhere. It is a risk to go out during an overcast day,
where legions of raindrops await their impending assault on unprepared pedestrians. Be sure to carry an umbrella!

### What will you do next week?
Crunch out web pages like a madman and avoid the rain. I want our website to look cool and modern so I am taking
the time to experiment. I also do not want to get wet. These will be my primary directives for the rest of the week.

### If you read it, what did you think of Paper #6: The Single Responsibility Principle?
The paper was a good read about organizing our code and I really appreciate how it is well-timed for each
phase of our project.

### What was your experience of factorial, reduce, and operators?
I have not used `reduce` before but it is a neat trick that I hope to use sometime in the future, whether
it be for a coding interview or for a python project. I look forward to learning more of these higher-order
functions that can speed up code development.

### What made you happy this week?
This week's UTPC competition was fun! I managed to snag food, a shirt, and a water bottle. I look forward to
getting more swag and completing problems in the future!

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Use [UT Night Ride](https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides)! Every month, you get $100 of Lyft credits. 
These credits can be used to go to your apartment past 12:00am and I have used them many times to study late on campus.
Although they can only be used when you are on campus, there is a region in west-campus that counts as on-campus
because it has university housing. I have attached a map of the coverage area below. have fun and stay safe!
