### What did you do this past week?
I worked on my SWE project, finished midterms, and completed a lot of interviews. Oh, and I 
also joined Intramural Soccer âš½! We had our first weekly match on Wednesday and it was an absolute blast. 
We lost but I know we will win the next one.

### What's in your way? 
My SWE project is still far from complete and I and my teammates are still wrangling the 
monster that is scraping data so that we can finish in time. I would like to finish 
adding all this data to the front-end as soon as possible.

### What will you do next week?
I will finish my SWE project, start running outside and practice for my next IM soccer match.

### If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #9: Interface Segregation Principle?
ISP is a good primer on the motivations behind having interfaces and multiple inheritances. 
I think multiple inheritances reign far above other object models and I wish it were the 
norm instead of regular inheritance. Either way, I look forward to using it in my projects!

### What were your experience of functions, closures, and decorators?
For a long time, I looked forward to learning about closures and decorators so I am glad we 
finally hit this topic. They occurred in multiple places during my coding career like 
Flask/backend API frameworks, Python `functools`, etc. Since they are paramount for so many 
complex libraries, I am glad that I gained familiarity with these tools.

### What made you happy this week?
Honestly, I am more excited about next week... it's Halloween ðŸŽƒ! Lots of celebration and themed
parties to visit and it heralds the beginning of end-of-year festivities. Cheers!

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
If you live off-campus, then you might live near an [Austin Bike Share](https://austin.bcycle.com/) bike rack. 
Bike share lets you rent a bike from any metro bike rack, which is available on and near UT campus
(see a [map of all bike racks](https://austin.bcycle.com/stations)). 
The best thing is, UT students can get an annual membership for $12 after signing up 
[on this form](https://austin.bcycle.com/university-of-texas-at-austin)!
You can find more info [on the UT website](https://parking.utexas.edu/bcycle).

Until next week!
