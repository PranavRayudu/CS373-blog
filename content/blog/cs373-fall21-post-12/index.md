### What did you do this past week?
I came back to campus and did a fantastic job of surviving the past week! I brought back more clothes for the winter, bathroom supplies, and a heck-ton of food, resulting in a pretty easy week. I also enjoyed my experiment noodle-chicken bowls using the recipe cards I snagged from Genghis Grill. If you ever go there, I recommend the *Spicy Chicken Korean Bowl* from the *Make Your Own Bowl* option. 

### What's in your way? 
I have 1 project due on Sunday and 3 projects, 1 exam due on Monday. That basically involves every class I am taking this semester... I do not even need to describe the size of my backlog.

### What will you do next week?
Next week will be my last week on campus before Thanksgiving so I will try to enjoy it the best I can with my friends. I also think the visualization requirement of Phase IV is the most interesting part of the project so I will start experimenting with 3D globe libraries.

### If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #12: More Getters and Setters?
The paper "More Getters and Setters", although useful, added a lot less to the conversation about getters and setters than the original paper. I wish we learned a new design paradigm or pattern that we can use in future projects. 

### What was your experience of cross join, theta join, natural join, and SQL?
Although I have used SQL before, I am new to relational algebra and cross-join, theta-join, and natural-join terms. I implicitly used them in various SQL statements though. 

### What made you happy this week?
I am excited about going back for thanksgiving more than anything that happened this week honestly. I have too much work to feel happy about my prospects right now.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
[Clark Field](https://www.utrecsports.org/facilities/facility/caven-lacrosse-and-sports-center-at-clark-field) is an awesome on-campus sports field that has a Soccer / Ultimate Frisbee / Lacrosse Field, Jogging track, Basketball courts, monkey bars, etc. that make it an excellent sports facility. You can check out any equipment you'd like until 11 pm night and have a ton of fun. Plan out your visit by finding the best time to visit Clark Field [here](https://www.utrecsports.org/about/isitbusy).

Until next week!
