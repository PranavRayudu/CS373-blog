### What did you do this past week?
I took a break after finishing Phase I for our project. We had a small hiccup with our Gitlab stats on the last day but
we managed to get it working on production. I had fun with friends and took it easy this week.

### What's in your way?
I have a few pending and future interviews that I need to get through. I hope to do a good job on them!

### What will you do next week?
Phase II! My team has started working on phase II and I think it will be a good one. In this phase, we are using 
linters, formatters, and issue boards to organize our code and work. Now that we are following all the suggestions
provided to us, this phase should go smoothly.

### If you read it, what did you think of Paper #7: Open-Closed Principle?
The Open-Closed principle is important to teach students but I honestly think it needs to be gained from experience. 
One of the interesting comments I saw mentioned that students do not understand this because school projects only run
1-2 weeks long and the Open-Closed principle is not so useful. It is more useful on longer, semester-long projects. 

### What was your experience of operators, and iteration?
As Dr. Downing said, Python has meticulously designed functionality for operators and iteration, although I think they 
are fairly simple. 

### What made you happy this week?
Such favorable weather! Sometimes I would walk out of class and just stand in the middle of Speedway because the 
temperature, lighting, and wind were just right. The last time I was able to do this on campus was freshman year, so it
brings back memories.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Go out y'all. During the evenings (around 5-6pm), the weather will be perfect for a walk outside or to just study. I 
recommend sitting by the benches in front of Greg or the green plaza behind Jester Center because they are excellent 
studying spots. Otherwise, take a walk down San Jacinto Boulevard which runs along Waller Creek if you just need 
to chill!

Until next week!
