### What did you do this past week?
I and my team finished phase 2! We pulled through after the 1-day extension, which gave us just enough time to 
complete all the requirements towards the climactic final hours. I also celebrated my friend's birthday and 
finished participating in [HackTX 2021](https://hacktx.com/). I am completely famished after working for 24hrs, 
but we won 3rd place for best blockchain project which you should check out 
[here](https://devpost.com/software/bitsnacks?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)!

### What's in your way? 
I have a massive backlog of work to do that I will get started on right after typing up this blog post. I have to 
finish my neural nets assignment, grade assignments, and prepare for interviews this week. 

### What will you do next week?
I will start on phase III and spend more time with my friends. I think we all agree that we need to make 
time in our busy schedules to meet each other and have fun.

### If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #10: Dependency Inversion Principle?
The Dependency Inversion Principle is an important general idea that I learned via trial and error. I think 
every programmer can agree that a well-designed software project takes the DIP into account.

### What was your experience of =, *, ** and regular expressions?
I think destructing is a complicated but very useful topic in Python. I see it used very frequently in 
machine learning libraries like PyTorch and Keras to make syntax clean. 
Moreover, I have lots of experience with regular expressions and use them frequently when editing 
code or formatting files.

### What made you happy this week?
Getting together with my friends to celebrate a birthday and winning something for HackTX was the climax 
of my past few weeks. I want to make sure the rest of my weeks are just as awesome as Halloween weekend!

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
For anyone interested in Blockchain or cryptocurrencies, [Texas Blockchain](https://txblockchain.org/) is
a UT org dedicated to the technical and financial side of cryptos. You can join their discord 
[here](https://discord.gg/rHEDeqrgQR) and they generally hold informational meetings and technical workshops on 
Wed and Thurs 6-7 pm in CBA 4.328.

Until next week!
