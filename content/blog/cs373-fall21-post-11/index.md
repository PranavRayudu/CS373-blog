### What did you do this past week?
This past week, I played IM soccer out in the rain and cold and went back home to Dallas for Diwali.
Soccer was brutal since it was windy, 50Â°F, and raining all at once on Wednesday... but it built character ðŸ’ª.
I also got to see my family in person for the first time after coming to campus, so that was
a nice change of pace. 

### What's in your way? 
For the first time this semester, I do not think I have any major blockers right now. I must make 
good progress on SWE phase III though.

### What will you do next week?
I will add filters and proper pagination and sorting and all sorts of eye candy to my SWE website. I hope 
that this phase goes more smoothly than the other phases since they were pretty rough towards the end.

Oh, and I probably ate the sugar output of an entire sugar field in sweets during this weekend so I will stay as 
healthy as possible this week. 

### If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #11: Getters and Setters?
The paper is rather basic in my opinion since it can be summarized in a few sentences. No doubt I agree 
that getters and setters are the banes of the OOP design pattern, but I caught that fairly early in my 
programming career and I am sure others are aware of the anti-pattern already.

### What was your experience of relational algebra, select, and project?
I am already familiar with relational algebra and the select/project statement because I have used it in 
my internship and past projects. I anticipate no friction in learning how they will be used in this class
or our SWE project.

### What made you happy this week?
I went back home for Diwali! I lit candles and Diya lamps to celebrate the occasion and 
just relaxed at home. I also got to attend my high school robotics team's regional competition for the fall season and 
catch up with my old engineering teachers. My team won regionals by a large margin!

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
The SWE project requires that your website is mobile responsive, and you should test your SWE frontend on a real phone. 
To do that, add `HOST=0.0.0.0` to your frontend's
`.env` file or replace `"start": "react-scripts start"` with `"start": "HOST=0.0.0.0 react-scripts start"` in 
your `package.json`. Next time you run `npm start`, you will see that your react project is hosted on `192.168.x.xx:xxxx`
instead of `localhost:xxxx`. Open this same link on your mobile phone to see your website!
> Note: Your phone and computer need to be on the same local network to communicate together.

Until next week!
