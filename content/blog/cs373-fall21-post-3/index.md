### What did you do this past week?
I spent the past week reading up on blockchains, practicing programming problems, and procrastinating on 
project Collatz.

### What's in your way?
Even though it feels like I have a lot of work to do, I know that it is simply a function of not managing time properly.
I spent too much time on distractions like watching random videos on Youtube or reading random blogs. While it is 
important to step away from work and take a break, I find that I use distractions to avoid stress. Instead,
I should plan out my day so I can work and get everything done.

### What will you do next week?
I will start implementing time-saving strategies like tracking time spent on projects, allocating fixed time per project, 
and making sure I get something done every time I sit down to work. The idea is if I plan out when I will take breaks, 
I will not feel like taking breaks all the time.

Oh, and the career fair is coming up. I also plan on visiting some exciting companies and introducing myself 
to their recruiters. I hope to see you all there!

### If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #3: Continuous Integration?
While it does a good job of introducing the philosophy of CI development, that paper was written in 2006 and it shows.

It uses arcane references (CruiseControl, Subversion, FIT, etc.) for tools no longer used, but I was hoping to learn 
about modern tools (Git, CircleCI, Github Actions, etc.) and how software teams take advantage of 
their capability and robustness.

### What was your experience of IsPrime and Collatz optimizations?
The `IsPrime` and `Collatz` projects were fairly easy to optimize, so they were stress-free; 
I look forward to more challenges like this!

### What made you happy this week?
I can see the results of my time at the gym! I can feel my posture improving and I am less tired after working all day.
If you have not hit the gym, try taking a run! A 10-minute jog is just as refreshing :)

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are not a fad. Blockchains like [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and 
[Etherum](https://ethereum.org/en/) already proved that they work as a decentralized financial system. 
However, there are other applications. Bleeding edge protocols like 
[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) allow you to store and serve files on demand and are
completely fault-proof. It is bringing about the widespread adoption of 
[web 3.0](https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b), where the internet is 
completely decentralized. Don't miss out. If you would like an awesome primer on blockchains, I linked a 
[3 Blue 1 Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) video for you to check out!
